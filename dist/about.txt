Established in 2012 by Amelia and Marco Rossi, Ace was born from a shared dream of creating a welcoming space where people could gather, celebrate, and indulge in the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean.
We believe in the power of food to connect us, and that's reflected in our philosophy of using fresh, seasonal ingredients sourced directly from local farms and producers.
